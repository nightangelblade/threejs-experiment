# three.js Experiment

Practice making use of three.js in a Rails application. Work in progress.

Current issue:
three.js library not being compiled. Currently added as
```//= require three```
in app/assets/javascript/application.js

Attempted standard inclusion, as well as using threejs-rails gem in Gemfile.

Error:
THREE is not defined in console when server is initialized.
